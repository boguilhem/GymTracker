# gymtracker

Track your fitness journey!

## How it Works?

You Can Add a new exercise with the button on the bottom of the screen.
Set the name, series and repetitions and hit Add!

If you feel like you made a mistake, you can click on the name of the exercise, and then you'll be able to edit and fit it.

As you achieve your fitness goals, you can mark each exercise as done by clicking on the little checkbox just beside it!

In case you feel like you don't need that exercise anymore, or just want to try something new, 
you can click and hold on the exercise name and it will vanish from your Gym Tracker like magic!

Enjoy your fitness journey with Gym Tracker. Keeping you on the right Path
